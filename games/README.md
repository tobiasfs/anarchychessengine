# The GAMES !!1!

Collection of descriontions of games. The descriptions are written to
describe the setup and rules of strategic abstract games with perfect
information (Everybody knows everything at every moment).

The descriptions are very formal, yet quit a range of constructs are
possible.

## The constructs

### What is there & how does it look?
* The board
* The pieces
* The players
* The trays

-> forms, colors, names, directions

(Not the starting positions, that is extra as this is special in a way.)

### How do we start?

 * The setup of the board with the pieces
 * Counters
 * Starting player

 -> absolute positions/directions (north, south, west, east, up, down)
 
 -> relative positions/directions (forwards, backwards, left, right) depends on the direction of the player and the figures
 
 -> positional reverences (center, horizontal center, vertical center, top half, bottom half, ...)

### Who wins?

Conditions that indicate a winning, loosing or a draw condition.
 * A certain position is reached
 * A certain piece on the board is removed
 * An attack, that cannot be evaded
 * Player indicating something (e.g. a "Draw" or "Give up")
 * A score is reached
 * No more moves are possible (for one player or perhaps for all players)
and also combinations of the things above.

A score might be calculated in the end and the one with the biggest or smalles score wins.
