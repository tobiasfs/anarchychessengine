This is vanilla go.
It is like tic-tac-toe but with different rules.

The board!

It is square. The grid is quadratic. The grid points are displayed and are called points.

It has 9 rows and 9 columns.
The columns and rows have arabic numbers and are numbered left to right. 
The rows have arabic numbers and are numbered bottom to top.

The pieces!

The pieces are called stones.
The stones can be placed.
A free point horizontally or vertically next to a stone is called a liberty. This liberty belongs to the stone. Liberties is the plural of liberty.
Each stone is in a group.
Pieces touching horizontally or touching vertically or touching diagonally with at least one free point next to the diagonal belong to the same group.
One stone in a groups has to have a liberty for the group to have a liberty.
A liberty inside a group are called an eye.
If a group has no liberties, it is removed from the board.

The setup!

The board is empty.
The black players tray holds infinite black stones.
The white players tray holds infinite white stones.

The game and finish!

Black starts.
The players take turns. 
A player sets one stone on the board per turn and the opponents groups are evaluated and the players groups are evaluated.
The same constellation is not allowed.

If both players "Pass" this is the end condition.

The score!

(Territory scoring for now.)
The number of liberties and the number of stones removed. This is the score. The score is to be maximised.
